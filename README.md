This project involves the design and implementation of a digital thermometer using an Arduino UNO R3, a thermistor, and an LCD display. The system measures room temperature and displays it in real-time on the LCD. It also features a temperature control mechanism using an RGB LED, which changes color based on the temperature range. The project demonstrates the use of various components such as an RTC module for timekeeping and I2C protocol for communication. The entire system is programmed using the Arduino IDE.
